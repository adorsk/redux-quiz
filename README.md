## Why?
I wanted a boilerplate for Redux/React that came with some initial structure, but not too much. 

## What's Inside?
I took some of my favorite parts from [react-transform-boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-boilerplate) and [react-redux-starter-kit](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit) (which I highly recommend). And I added a few of my own.

See `package.json` for the full list of dependencies.
